# **Autosplitters for Livesplit**<br>
[Download Livesplit](https://livesplit.org/downloads/)<br>
These are mostly functional and don't always follow good coding practices as I learned a lot of things while writing them, I wouldn't necessarily recommend them as examples.<br><br>
*If you have any comment or issue with the autosplitter or this README, contact me on Discord `Nepo.` or send me a message on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Nepo)<br>
Any help or suggestion is appreciated!*<br>
### Outer Wilds:<br>
* Main project. Full of features (perhaps even a bit bloated oops)<br>
### Sunblaze:<br>
* Should still be ok, but hasn't been worked on in a while.<br>
### Cave Crawler:<br>
* Old and very imperfect.<br>
* **If you have the community's agreement** you can submit your own autosplitter for this game to replace this one.<br>
You also have my permission to use this autosplitter as a basis for your own.<br>
In both cases I'd appreciate to be notified, and if necessary credited.<br>
